# 2.  **Inferential statistics**
Inferential statistics is a subfield of statistics that focuses on drawing conclusions or making predictions about a larger group (population) through a smaller group (sample) of individuals based on some information collected from them. By applying different methods in statistics, it enables one to make assumptions regarding the main features of people’s lives like population average, percentage and relationship among variables using a limited set of observed values.
## 1.**Hypothesis Testing**
Hypothesis testing involves making decisions about a population parameter based on sample data. It generally consists of stating a null hypothesis, often denoted as H0, and an alternative hypothesis, often denoted as Ha, in addition to collecting sample data and then using statistical tests to see whether there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.
- Null Hypothesis(H0): This is a general statement or default position of two measured cases where nothing has happened. In other words, there is no relationship between them, or no relationship among groups. It means a basic assumption or made based on the problem knowledge.
- Alternative hypothesis (H1):The alternative hypothesis represents the alternative being tested in the hypothesis testing and is opposite to null hypothesis.

**Step to testing Hypothesis Testing**

- **Level of significance** : It is the amount of confidence that we want on accepting or rejecting the null hypothesis. While accepting the hypothesis, we can't gain 100% accuracy. Normally consider the significance level as 5%. Usually, α = 0.05 or 5% which states that with 95% confidence level, the output would be same for any kind of sample population.
- **p-value**: The probability of obtaining the observed/ extreme results, assuming that the null hypothesis H0 is true. If the p-value obtained is less than the significance level, then we reject the null hypothesis.
- **Test Statistic**: The numerical value computed from the sample data in testing a hypothesis, which is compared to the rejection region or critical values to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis.
- **Critical Value**: The value of a test statistic that a null hypothesis is rejected if the value of test statistic either greater than or less than.

- **Degree of Freedom**: The degree of freedom pertains to the variability or freedom one has in estimating a parameter. It is related to sample size and determines the shape of the distribution.

**type of Hypotheis Testing**
- **Single-tailed test**

    - **Left-Tailed or Left-Sided Test**: The alternative hypothesis offers the statement that the true value of the parameter is less than the null hypothesis.Example: H0​:
μ≥50 and H1: μ<50
    - **Right-Tailed (Right-Sided) Test**: This type of test represents that the alternative hypothesis asserts that the actual value of the parameter is greater than the value included in the null hypothesis. 
    Example: H0 : μ≤50 and H1:μ>50
- **Two-Tailed Test**
A two-tailed test takes into account both the greater than and less than in direction against a given value. We use a two-tailed test when there isn't any explicit expectation in either direction and we want to find out any significant difference.
Example: H0: μ= 50 and H1: μ≠50

**Test Statistic:**

- **Z-test**: Widely used in cases when the sample size is greater and the standard deviation of the population is known. Employed during the comparison between different samples or groups to draw inductive interference for populations. Emphasis on the probability of observing data given that some premises or hypotheses are valid. Provide a framework for assessing the evidence supporting as well as opposing a specific.

   Z = (x – μ) / (σ / sqrt(n))

    Where

    Z is the test statistic

    x is the sample mean

    μ is the hypothesized population mean

    σ is the population standard deviation

    n is the sample 

- **T-Test**: A test applied for finding a significant difference between the means of two groups. It is a test most often used when data is normally distributed and the population variances are unknown. T-test is one of the test procedures in hypothesis testing in which it tests whether a difference between two groups really exists, or is it because of chance.

$$
t = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}}
$$


- **Chi-square test**: The Chi-square test is a statistic utilized in an attempt to prove the existence of any significant relationship between two nominal measures. It has a very broad application in testing whether two variables are independent and the differences between observed frequencies in a contingency table and frequencies that would be expected under independence.

**P-value**

P-Value Interpretation

- **P-value > 0.05**: The result is not statistically significant, so do not reject the null hypothesis.
  
- **P-value < 0.05**: The result is statistically significant. Generally, reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.

- **P-value < 0.01**: The result is highly statistically significant, thus reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.

**Type I & Type II Errors** 

**Type 1 Error (α-error)**

A type 1 error, also called an α-error, happens when a true null hypothesis is rejected. In other words, this means that there is a statistically significant difference or relationship found by the test when the reality is that there is no real difference or relationship.

**Type 2 Error (β-error)**

A Type 2 error, which occurs when a false null hypothesis is not rejected, is also called the β-error. This relates to the failure of a test in finding a difference or relationship that is statistically significant when, actually, there is a real difference or relationship.
